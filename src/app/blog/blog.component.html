      <span><br>
                At the moment, to me "AI" seems like a method for using training data to carve out essentially vinyl disks of models that fit some types of behavior, classification, etc.
                It's a great step since the logic we are writing is now slightly more organic and not generated manually. However, some current limitations of these models seem to be that they
                are brittle and not able to generalize themselves. The output is very correlated to the input which is usually tailor made for a specific function. This is all well and
                good when you know the input is going to conform to this training set. However, it is limited to how it was trained and doesn't seem to be able to connect to other
                models very well...
