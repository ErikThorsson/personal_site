                    Over the past year I've gained a newfound appreciation for finance and the many markets of the world. It's a living breathing ecosystem and one truly has to be an expert in whatever neck of the woods they venture into. On top of that, the various financial instruments available make these ecosystems rich and complex. If I was to extend the analogy for finance/investing as a whole, there really do seem to be many parallels between it and life itself in many ways. At it's most basic level, it is simply the systems that society uses to distribute resources within itself - a kind of cardiovascular system for the world. The more complex nuances of this world are more nervous system like and contain logic that makes money move more intelligently.
                <p>
                    This starts with business processes conducted by people and extends all the way to the autonomous algorithmic trading of assets. This near personification of money into an entity that trades itself to gain value fascinates me to no end and seems to almost give it life as it becomes "smart money". Philosophically, at this point, the entity seems to reflect an organism which is fighting for survival (account value), whose goals mimic that of other organisms (reproduction - account value increase). But I'm getting too deep here. I will get into algorithmic trading maybe sometime in the future.
                <p>
                    The many organisms that live within this financial world - speculators, market makers, conservative loan providers, venture capitalists, passive index investors, day traders - together pump the world's heart and eventually lead the way towards market efficiency through efficient resource distribution. This in turn fuels the gradual evolution of the world as it goes through market cycles of boom and bust towards a gradual long term positive beta of world growth. One of the greatest hedge fund managers of our time, Ray Dalio posted a fantastic video on the business market cycle (both in the short and long term) that described what seems to have lead to the Great Recession in 2008. I found it rather interesting from a macro-economic standpoint.

                    I wore a few different hats this year and explored at least at some shallow level what it is like to play some parts in the world's financial stage. I began as a passive investor as most do with passive investments in the S&P through my Roth and 401k. Then, since I work in tech, I tried some targeted stock picks in the technology world. I was pretty lucky for us to still be in a great tech boom so picks like MSFT and SPLK provided great returns over the past year. I bought MSFT because I wanted exposure to growth in cloud computing which I had first-hand experience in with at my day job (in retrospect I should have gone with AMZN but thought they may have been overpriced with more room for growth with Azure vs AWS). I had also used SPLK at work to parse vast amounts of machine logs and could see how this would become more valuable as more automation took place and machine logging continued to grow.
                <p>
                    Naturally, I was intrigued by crypto and jumped into that over a year ago as I detailed in my previous post. As this was kind of a hybrid stock/commodity I was drawn to futures after this. I only dabbled with the Emini (S&P futures) though but the concept of natural supply and demand controlling futures prices made it interesting in combination with the high leverage they provided. It would seem that you could have a little more confidence in your high leverage trades with an understanding of the commodities involved. Stock prices in the short term feel more random by comparison. E.g. soybeans contracts have been crushed in value since Trump instigated the trade war with China. In retrospect I wish I had jumped into that, but I was still a little fearful of futures after getting burned once by the Emini. I traded this for minutes at a time due to its huge leverage and naturally placed stop losses to protect myself. After making about 30% (~$300) trading single contracts I manually sold a long contract and forgot to close my stop loss. The price then fell and it sold a contract making me short. Shortly after that, Trump tweeted something that made the market bullish and the S&P rallied about 2% causing me to lose 100% or about $2000 in about the span of an hour before I realized what had happened. Despite this accident, it was a great lesson in the power of leverage and taught me to be exceptionally cautious when dealing with it going forward.
                <p>
                    I moved into options trading after this as you cannot lose more than you put into a short position (since shorting gives you unlimited risk). I made some bad trades with this after not fully understanding the greeks well enough to calculate my true risk of positioning. This was because I wasn't fully calculating the time decay of the option and the leverage I was taking on each trade. This meant my trades weren't weighted equally so over time losses added up. After those losses, I decided I would put on the training wheels and learn how to trade options with a small account. I put in around a pay check and began meticulously inputing each trade into a spreadsheet so I could quantify my risk/reward and track my results in order to improve my strategy. This kind of discipline reaped its rewards and I slowly learned not to risk more than 10% of my account on a trade (without high certainty and lower leverage) and to take profit early instead of getting greedy (usually 10-30% profit). In retrospect, 1-5% is probably the only truly sustainable position size with leveraged momentum trading. I probably got lucky with the general market conditions.
                <p>
                    Either way, I managed to get this account to about 25% profit in a little over a month. About 1/3 of this came from a heavily positioned trade a few weeks from MSFT earnings which was driven by their strong fundamentals and favorable technicals and sentiment. This trifecta seems like the golden goose for trading if you can manage to find it. The rest of the trades were mostly extremely short term (1-2 days) and were mostly based on mean reversion theory where prices technically looked like they were moving back towards a mean price range. I usually started the trade when it appeared that there was a trend and tried to get the meat of it in the middle, not holding it long enough to risk it moving back against me.

                    Then I decided to gamble these profits on a TSLA earnings play a few days before expiration...

                    Don't ever bet against what people consider the future I guess. I should have known this coming from crypto. Unsurpisingly, that trade wiped out when TSLA pulled a huge reversal rising 20% despite having a lower EPS. In retrospect, the company may be geared towards finally achieving profit in the coming year so I should have thought about that narrative vs their short term financial picture. Despite not being profitable for 15 years and having a heavy debt load, investors are willing to buy this stock by buying into an Amazon like growth narrative since this company may very well be a powerful disruptive force. Either way, I broke the rule of risking a small part of the portfolio and it rightfully turned against me. It was somewhat consoling to see that I wasn't completelty alone and that David Einhorn, a historically successful hedge fund manager, and I both felt that burn. No matter which way this ends up going markets can be irrational for pretty extended periods of time so sometimes the only way to win is not to play the game. Elon then went on to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://fortune.com/2018/08/01/david-einhorn-elon-musk-tesla-short-seller/">publicly taunt Einhorn.</a> Despite my respect for what the guy has achieved, that seems pretty unprofessional.

                    Next, in an equally stupid "r/wallstreetbets" fashion, I put 50% of my account into puts after the post earnings run-up in the hope that buyers were exhausted after an 18% jump. My exit strategy is to get out if the stock goes down another 1.6% for a 30% gain. I'm way over-weighted here but there doesn't seem to be as much risk of the stock going up at this point (so I can hopefully set a stop loss for +1-2% for a -20-40% trade). I acknowledge that this could very easily go poorly but the technicals are turning towards a plateau which often leads to a short sell off in stocks post earnings (1-2 days) as traders take profits. There's a pretty decent chance that it shoots up 5%+ and wipes out that trade completely. Luckily this is still the small learning account so I can lose a large chunk of it if it comes to that...
                <p>
                    If that trade goes well, I don't plan on continuing such reckless behavior. I will continue to track my trades in a google spreadsheet in order to keep myself discplined and to hopefully form a profitable strategy. As you will see below, my stock trades have been highly unprofitable this year so I was determined to not repeat my mistakes. When I traded equities a few months ago, I was actually up by about 15% and then quickly lost it all with impulsive, uncalculated high leveraged trades, a bad short (against Spotify after IPO), and that futures mishap. I'm currently net even with the options trades since I just blew my profits on that outright gamble (though my current trade may be a harsh burn).
                <p>
                    What's key in the world of leveraged trading is making the trading positions small enough that probability will eventually favor you if your strategy is strong enough. You may not even win more than 50% of trades but if your stop losses are tight enough, those small cuts on losing trades won't overwhelm the big winning trades. You have to play defensive enough to stay in the game when things don't go your way (especially if you were to go on a long unlucky losing streak). Since this is so short term focused, this form of trading is more like managed gambling where you play as the house with say a 5% edge. Over time, probability will make things right "if" you have that edge.
                <p>
                    This is covered in detail in a fantastic book called Market Wizards. The book contains interviews with some of the most successful traders from around the 70's and 80's. They even made a great point that much of their advice won't be helpful in future markets but some of this advice is timeless and the way they describe how they built their trading strategies contains nuggets of wisdom. One of the great commodity traders of the past, Ed Seykota I believe, used a similar strategy to the leveraged one I was describing above. His edge was he had a system, where he ran his models through punch card computers. My take away from his interview is that on top of an edge the only way to be consistently profitable is to engineer your trade from start to finish. You have to plan your exit before you enter. That way he was able to take advantage of powerful leverage on commodities in a consistent enough way to become exceptionally successful. His edge was often specialized technical analysis which worked well for commodities due to the real ebb and flow of demand for them in the world.

                    Many people seem to think technical analysis is hocus pocus but I think I have to agree with some traders from this book that it depends on certain contexts. The type of market and the time frame can make a difference. For example in equities, if big news like an earnings report is about to happen then you might want to give less weight to the technical price movement. There is a large chance of volatility that could go either way. A few recent examples have shown that playing the contrarian to the technical direction can sometimes work in one's favor. Recently, some social media stocks: Facebook and Twitter, took huge hits after their earnings reports but this is coupled with controversy that has plagued both companies (privacy for facebook and fake accounts on twitter). So during inflection points like this in the stock market, playing purely technical trades appears to be a bad gamble usually. Some traders have managed to capture volatility in either direction using option strangles composed of selling options in both directions in the short term for high premiums due to high volatility and then buying a strangle on the back end. They have a high chance of profiting with their sales due to IV crush that happens after earnings. So my take on technicals is it can be a nice indicator to add to others for short term trades depending on the circumstances. E.g. In the stock market, purely technical trades can sometimes function by themselves for very short periods of time in between earnings or other large news events. Weighing it more heavily than that seems like it may work better for commodities (perhaps FOREX). It also worked somewhat for crypto as that market action was also mostly demand/supply oriented due to its highly speculative nature.
                <p>
                    Another key point in that book that was repeated was always playing defensively and constantly thinking "how can this decision lose". You have to be a little paranoid if you are making big trades and constantly monitor the process either in real time or with stop losses or profit taking orders set up through your broker. This is the only real way for those of us like myself with day jobs to trade during the week. Often, like with that last TSLA trade, I see profits as money on the house that can be burned in reckless ways and this almost always turns out poorly. You have to start each day viewing your account value as being at its starting capital so you can manage it responsibly. If a trade goes in your favor, great, but then move the stop loss up higher just in case it goes against you so you don't waste your hard earned profit. Since I didn't follow this philosophy with my last two trades, I will probably continue to suffer the results. The market is an unpredictable beast that wants to take your money. You have to fight it every day if you're actively trading and not just passively investing. Otherwise, you're better off as a passive investor.
