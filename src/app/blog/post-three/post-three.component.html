                I was first introduced to the concept of trading as I'm sure many are - a burst of unusual market euphoria resulting in what we call a market bubble. I heard murmurs of its onset in the fall of 2016 with coworkers casually mentioning their eccentric friends putting money into this thing called Bitcoin. I shrugged it off as I had over the years as some oddity who's only real use was for black market transactions, hacker's ransoms and the like. Why should we abandon the tried and true national fiat currencies to become our own bank? Plus on a daily basis, the thing was eating enormous amounts of energy (<a href="https://qz.com/1281850/bitcoins-energy-consumption-is-as-much-a-year-as-all-of-ireland-says- the-first-peer-reviewed-study-on-the-subject">some say as much yearly as Ireland</a>) to give the network like 7 transactions per second. It felt ethically wrong to support the thing.
                <p>
                <p>Fast forward to April of 2017 and my cousin on the West Coast is telling me about this radical new cryptocurrency called Ethereum. People are calling it a distributed world computer - a programmable trustless network run by anyone and everyone meant to cut the no longer needed middle men out of the equation. A distributed network would mean data isn't held by any centralized source that can use this treasure trove for its own benefit or be an irresposible steward of it like Equifax or any of the other large corporations that have been hacked in recent years. This novel social and technological experiment peaked my interest but most of all its 1000% jump in price since that Christmas was impossible to ignore. I put some skin in the game in late May to try my luck and was in bliss as I saw the price rocket up by 30% over the next few weeks. After seeing my index funds slowly appreciate, this kind of movement felt like the holy grail.

                <p>Of course like all things too good to be true, after ignoring my internal voice yelling SELL!, I saw my utopian internet money go from +30% to -25% in the blink of an eye (over the course of a week). I sold for a loss of a few hundred bucks and left that bizarre internet community with a sour taste in my mouth. That's what you get for buying penny stocks disguised as something "new". The technology's limitations as far as scaling to the need of a large network and its absurd resource inefficiencies also seemed like they would be a bottleneck to any future growth. Around this time, a decentralized app or Dapp was created that completelty clogged the network. It was called crypto kitties - some type of collectible trading game that brought back Beanie Baby like nostalgia. In line with the times, these collectible cats were trading for as much as 100k at the beginning of the fervor. I went back to trying to learn how to play the stock market...

                <p> Something like this doesn't just leave your head though. It left an itch that I scratched by checking the price occasionally over the next few months. After finally seeing a positive trend in price and sentiment I bought back in in October with the money I had withdrawn in June. Nothing happened for a month. And then BAM! An enormous rocketing in price in about a week that sent my gains to 50%. Having learned my lesson previously, I immediately sold, making back my lost money plus a few hundred bucks. I felt like I had successfully played the bubble this time and waited for another expected crash. Nothing happened though.

                <p> This was around Thanksgiving time, which in hindsight, was what may have partially led to a perfect storm. Everyone was with their families trying to one up each other with this year's stories. It would be hard to top the run some people had had with crypto that year and people were bound to catch some FOMO (fear of missing out). During this time I was out of the market and as a programmer was thinking about all the technical limitations these systems had. This was logically keeping me out.

                <p> However, in comes a new iteration on the scene - something called Iota. The guys working on this promised that they had solved the scaling issue with something called the Tangle. It also wasn't something that was wasting energy being mined, using minimal amounts of electricity. This was curious enough to lure me back in. The coin's price instantly started going up as well, providing what felt like justified positive feedback. The community was on fire at this point with a new system being advertised what felt like every day. People were creating subreddits on Reddit for their favorite coins and cheering them on like sports teams. The rivalry was fierce and moderators were constantly trying to control the masses from "brigading" or, as it would later be renamed, incessant shilling.

                <p> This is when I began a journey of swing trading, jumping from subreddit to subreddit riding the waves of hype and trying to do my best due diligence by reading the technical "whitepapers" released by each project. I put in a small amount into Iota and saw it grow by something like 50% in a week. The time seemed ripe to ride these waves. Sentiment on the internet was off the charts and google trends were going parabolic for crypto keywords. My investment thesis was this was a bubble that I would ride so I put in a couple paychecks in savings and began my journey early December. With some luck in timing and constant research apparently this was enough of an edge in the seas of euphoria. I started my journey buying something called Cardano, a project started by one of Ethereum's old founders. He promised to make the technology something backed by academic integrity.

                    This seemed the most legitimate of all the projects of the time seeing as most were just run by eccentric programmers who followed their own rules. I liked Iota's simple proposition but it only had a small use case really, transactions and small data transfer. It seemed like a platform would be a stronger investment. In a month it's value rocketed up 1000%. I began diversifying as it went up in price and eventually saw a 300% profit when I miraculously sold at its peak of $1.14. This was mostly a fluke as I had talked with a coworker and agreed that perhaps the project was too academic without enough real world use.

                <p> Next I jumped onto a network that was technologically similar to Iota. The problem with Iota was it was extremely ambitious but the network wasn't functioning properly. This other network, called Raiblocks (now Nano), was sending and receieving payments on its network in seconds. Compared to other popular networks like Ethereum that could take minutes, or Bitcoin which could take as long as hours, this was mind blowing. It was low priced because only a small sketchy exchange named Bitgrail really sold it. I took a huge risk by sending funds to this exchange and prompty got them out of it. Unsurprisingly, through either incompetence or scam, the exchange later lost millions in users funds and the creator is now embattled with lawsuits. Regardless, I put 33% of my portfolio into this coin at $10 and saw it rocket up 200%. I was lucky enough to be able to trade it and get my funds out of Bitgrail.

                <p> By this time I was up around 280% on my original investments in the span of a month. But of course I didn't stop. I jumped on the next ship... Vechain. They promised to be the premier enterprise blockchain solution and touted a CEO that had formerly been the CIO of Luis Vuitton China. They advertised their platform at first as a perfect solution for counterfeit luxury goods which was apparently a rampant problem in China. By implanting an RFID chip into these goods they could be verified on the public ledger as legitimate. This seemed like a fantastic real world solution compared to all the hot air I'd seen in other projects. I went all in and put 100% into the project at a price of $2.6. Over the next month it rose to great heights, even hitting $9 at some point. I was drunk on crypto at this point and told myself that even though Bitcoin was falling, this was the future so their markets wouldn't be correlated. My family members urged me to sell but in my stubbornness I believed that since they had been wrong about this investment at first they were still wrong. I had completely forgotten my initial thesis of riding the bubble and had become indoctrinated into crypto-land. Well, as we now know, the month of January was the end of the bubble. I saw my gains vaporize extremely quickly but still got out at a respectable $4.5 for an 80% gain.

                <p>
                    During this time I tried to build my own algorithmic momentum trader using one of the largest exchange's APIs. The idea was a bot could catch large price surges quickly and get in and get out. The python code is in my github. In practice this was harder to pull off than I imagined though, and it mostly bought high and sold low. I tried to turn it into a mean reversion trader that only traded one coin after that before losing interest. There was probably more potential in this method, but by this time the bubble was coming to its peak and I no longer had the enthusiasm to attempt this. Using price signals and other minute technical indicators is probably best left to the professionals. Competition within this microcosm of the trading sphere is intense and often measured in milliseconds. What had brought me success was something I hadn't been able to automate yet - sentiment analysis combined with fundamental analysis and a splash of technical analysis.

                <p> Of course, when I saw the dead cat bounce in February I bought back in at the top with 75% of my profits and didn't sell until I had lost 33% of them. Easy come easy go. For a novice trader I didn't have the kind of discpline to protect my gains. Soon after, the overconfidence gleamed from my crypto run ran me into trouble as I thought this would translate into the stock market and futures. A few bad decisions and one mistake using a futures system saw another 20% of my original profits disappear. At that point I realized that I had mistaken extremely lucky timing and understanding of one niche market for general trading ability and put my remaining profits into something much harder to lose, a mortgage. From the month of December to January I had soared to incredible heights with a 450% paper profit. I almost fell like Icarus but managed to cash out for around a 130% gain. I was lucky to have enough rational people around me to make me stop and think for a moment.

                <p> For now I will watch the scene again from the sidelines until I see someone deliver real world use, not just hype. I can see how distributed public ledgers with smart contracts may change the world in incredible ways by creating public utilities that will replace current institutions, making them cheaper, faster, and more protectective of our information. Escrow services may soon be replaced by machines. Only time will tell what becomes AOL, Pets.com, Amazon, and Google however. Stay tuned. Stay vigilant.
